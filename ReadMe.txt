This is useful if you're sending exported avatars to people through discord and you don't want to spend time manually editing the export file to look neat

This works for both EMM and ODIOUS exports, I will add support for more clients if requested (not like anyones gonna use this, this shit's very niche)

1.) Name the exported EMM file to "EMM.txt" (without quotes)
1.) Name the exported ODIOUS file to "ODIOUS.txt" (without quotes)
2.) Put "EMM.txt" in same folder as "ExportEmmOdiousToReadable.jar"
2.) Put "ODIOUS.txt" in same folder as "ExportEmmOdiousToReadable.jar"

You don't need both of the files for this to work, only one file is needed

If you run "ExportEmmOdiousToReadable.jar" without any required files it'll do nothing

Once your txt file(s) are in the same folder as "ExportEmmOdiousToReadable.jar", open "ExportEmmOdiousToReadable.jar" and boom, neat avatars

Source code is in Src if any of you guys are scared to run it :)
